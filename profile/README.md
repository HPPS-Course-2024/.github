# HPPS Course 2024
We are Simon and Victor, a two-person group who have worked collaboratively on our High Performance Programming and Systems (HPPS) course. All coding was done using Live Share sessions, ensuring equal participation from both of us. Although everything has been pushed from Simon's PC, all contributions were made collaboratively during Live Share sessions to reflect the teamwork.
